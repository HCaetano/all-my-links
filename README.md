# All My Links

It's [live](https://havyner.netlify.app/) on Netlify.

This project is a version of Linktree and is based on [Codante's links page project](https://codante.io/mini-projetos/pagina-de-links). The point of it was to make a simple page to display my professional-related links. Besides a link to my GitHub profile, people can find links to my LinkedIn profile, my portfolio and a downloadable resume (in Portuguese).

On the code side, the page is static, its content is read from a json file, and it's all made on HTML, CSS, JS, no frameworks. As for the CSS, I took the opportunity to use the BEM pattern.
